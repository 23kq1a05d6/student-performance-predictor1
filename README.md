### 🎓 *Project Name: Student Performance Predictor*

#### 📘 *What the project does*

This project predicts a student’s *semester percentage* and whether they will *Pass or Fail* based on their academic details.
The user enters information like:

* Attendance percentage
* Previous CGPA
* Study hours per week
* Assignment completion rate
* Mid exam marks
* Quiz/test scores

The app then uses *Machine Learning* to analyze these details and give a prediction about the student’s result and expected percentage.

#### ⚙ *How to install or run it*

1. Save the project files (including app.py and student_data.csv) in one folder.
2. Open *VS Code* or *Command Prompt* in that folder.
3. Make sure you have *Python* installed.
4. Install the required libraries by typing:

   
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn
   
5. Run the app using the command:

   
   streamlit run app.py
   
6. A web page will open showing your app where you can enter student details and get predictions.
